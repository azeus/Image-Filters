Image Filters Project

Welcome to the Image Filters project! This repository is a playground to explore and experiment with a wide variety of image filters. The goal of this project is to dive into the world of image manipulation and find the filters that resonate most with me while learning the underlying techniques.

Project Overview

This project includes implementations of filters across different categories. The focus is on experimenting with diverse effects to understand their impact on images and to discover personal favorites.

Categories and Filters

Here are the broad categories and sub-categories of filters implemented so far:
	1.	Colour Temperature
	•	Warm
	•	Cool
	2.	Monochromatic
	•	Grayscale
	•	Black and White
	3.	Aged
	•	Sepia
	•	Vintage
	4.	Toning
	5.	Saturation
	6.	Contrast
	7.	Artistic
	8.	Colour Shift
	9.	Noise/Grain
	•	Noise
	•	Grain
	10.	Blur/Sharpen
	•	Blur
	•	Sharpen
	11.	Vignette
	12.	Special
	•	HDR (High Dynamic Range)
	•	LOMO (Lomography)

Repository Structure

This repository contains Python scripts for implementing each filter and associated utilities:
	•	sinus.py: Core functionality for sinusoidal transformations.
	•	summer.py: Filters that evoke summer vibes.
	•	windy.py: Filters for breezy, airy effects.
	•	winter.py: Cool and crisp filters inspired by winter.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
	•	numpy
	•	Pillow

Install the dependencies using:

pip install numpy pillow

Usage

Each filter can be applied to an image using the respective scripts. Here’s how you can get started:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone repo-url
cd Image-Filters


	2.	Run any filter script:

python filter-script.py


	3.	Provide the path to your image when prompted, and explore the effects!

Goals

	•	To explore a wide range of image filters.
	•	To identify favorite filters for future creative projects.
	•	To learn and enhance Python skills in image processing.
